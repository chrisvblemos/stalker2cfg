This is a dump of .cfg files from Stalker 2 game, extracted using FModel.

These are configuration files for damage, AI, quest logic, etc.
The data format is custom-made and serialized by an Unreal Plugin built by GSC and until they release it or someone builds a parser, dealing with these files manually is the only way to go.
